Discussions\n","In this task, we tested the performance and accuracy of our naive bayes model, when using 3 different methods - count vectorizer, term frequency (tf) and term frequency - inverse document frequency (tfidf) methods.<br>\n","**Everytime we run the code, we get different accuracy in all the 3 models, this is because of the random splitting of movie-reviews dataset into test and train sets.**<br>\n","\n","**Q1**. Describe how you formulate the problem of sentiment analysis for movie reviews using the simple word count features and naïve Bayes method.<br>\n",">**Ans**. The problem of sentiment analysis for movie reviews using simple word count features and naive bayes method can be formulated in the following steps:\n","1.   Collection of movie reviews with labels:\n","  *   Gather a dataset of movie reviews and label each review as positive, negative, or neutral.\n","2.   Split the data into training set and testing set:\n","  *   Divide the dataset into two subsets, a training set and a testing set.\n","3.   Extract the word count features:\n","  *   Count the number of positive and negative words in each review and use those counts as features for the classifier. We also calculate the TD and TD-IDF to measure the occurence of a word in a review and the the most relevant reviews relevant to a word.\n","4.   Build the naïve Bayes classifier from the training set:\n","  *   Train the classifier on the training set, using the word count features and the review labels as inputs.\n","5.   Apply the classifier on testing data set:\n","  *   Use the classifier to predict the sentiment of the reviews in the testing set.\n","6.   Evaluate the performance:\n","  *   Calculate the classifier's accuracy, precision, and recall on the testing set to evaluate its performance.\n","\n","**Q2**. Implement solutions using both the tf and tf-idf features.<br>\n",">**Ans**. To implement tf and tf-idf in our code, we need to transform the training text data (X_train) into its tf or tf-idf matrix. Once done, we fit the transformed data along with actual fileId to the MultinomialNB classifier to train our model.<br> \n","This model could then be validated against the transformed test data. <br>\n","*Code above in the section \"Implementing solutions using Word Count, TF and TF-IDF features & Evaluating the Performance\"*<br>\n","\n","**Q3**. Evaluate the performance and discuss your results.<br>\n",">**Ans**. The performance can be measured by running classification_report method from metrics library. It gives us the precision, recall, f1-score, support and accuracy.<br>\n","Based on the performance metrics provided, it appears the Count Vectorisor and TF-IDF Vectorisor are more accurate with accuracy of 81% than the TF Vectorisor with an accuracy of 68%.<br>\n","However, the recall and precision scores for each class (positive and negative) vary among the three methods. For the positive class, the Count Vectorisor and TF-IDF Vectorisor both have a recall of 80% and a precision of 81%, while the TF Vectorisor has a lower recall of 38% but a higher precision of 97%. For the negative class, the Count Vectorisor and TF-IDF Vectorisor both have a recall of 81% and a precision of 80%, while the TF Vectorisor has a higher recall of 99% but a lower precision of 60%.<br>\n","Overall, the Count Vectorisor and TF-IDF Vectorisor seem to perform the best, with balanced recall and precision scores for both classes. The TF Vectorisor has lower overall accuracy and imbalanced scores for the positive and negative classes.<br>\n","The sentiment analysis visualisation also shows us the variance in the probabilities for the given word.

Someones even made the statement that science is\n","\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" This is getting a bit silly\n","and the word \"objective\" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the\n","definition of \"objective\" which has been already presented:\n","\n","  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \n","    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.\n","    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\n","    observable phenomenon.\n","\n","The Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that\n","thing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there\n","exist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable\n","phenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental\n","processes, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\n","phenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \n","Even weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\n","that observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\n","affected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\n","change to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\n","objective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\n","point of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively \"good;\" I\n","will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \n","\n","Now some examples things which are \"objective\":  A D-12 tractor is larger\n","than the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\n","There exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \n","ultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\n","\n","\"Good\" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have an\n","existence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\n","existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined \"good\").  We cannot\n","quantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\n","full of \"good\").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word \"good\" an\n","objective meaning, e.g.  \"good\" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\n","speed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\n","\"strength\" and etc, as necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \n","is not generally viewed as \"good\"). \n","\n","As to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\n","on verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\n","the \"Golden Rule,\" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\n","people off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\n","manner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you \"get in someone's face,\"\n","they will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\n","more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\n","at times, ignore that form of the \"Golden Rule\" without fear of reprisal.  Now\n","as to whether this enforcing of morality is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quite\n","subjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\n","cannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\n","that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\n","existence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\n","thing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\n","morality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\n","morality. \n","\n","One other thing to notice, \"objective\" is many times used as synonymous with\n","\"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometimes has the connotation of\n","\"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when a\n","conclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\n","both objective and false.  As to \"absolute,\" it is easy to note that while we\n","can objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\n","that all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\n","either.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\n","\"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" For instance, there are some theists who are\n","specifically \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have only\n","subjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\n","has been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to\n","investigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\n","necessary to support a true hypothesis.
