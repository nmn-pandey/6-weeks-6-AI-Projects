The class contains the following methods:\n","1.   **generate_initial_population**: generates a population of list of randomly ordered cities representing the order of traversal.\n","2.   **fitness**: returns the fitness of a chromosome i.e. the inverse of the sum of distances, implying a lower sum of distances is considered to be more fit. If the sum of distances is less than SATISFACTORY_COST, the method returns 100, which terminates the GA.\n","3.   **crossover**: genetic operator that performs crossover on two lists and returns two new lists created through combination of the two parent lists at a random crossover point.\n","4.   **mutation**: genetic operator that performs mutation by swapping the values at two random indexes in the list.\n","5.   **selection**: performs selection using the roulette wheel method\n","6.   **genetic_algorithm**: main method for running the GA. It performs the genetic operators on the population until either termination condition is reached or the number of generations are completed.\n","7.   **sum_of_distance**: returns sum of distances for visiting the cities in the list and returning to the starting city.\n","8.   Other utility function such as *mutate_until_unique* to reduce number of generations needed to reach the solution, *individual_crossover* to perform as auxilary method for *crossover*, *get_min_max_fitness* to get minimum and maximum fitness in a generation, and *display_population* to display all chromosomes in the population.\n","\n","Comments are included in the code to explain the purpose of each method.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"52iOr0lzL4aO","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1673250137353,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":17496,"user":{"displayName":"Naman

to implement the solution to Travelling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm.\n","\n","**Q1.** Explain how you would design a genetic algorithm to solve the TSP. Specify the encoding scheme, fitness function and genetic operators. <br>\n","> **Ans**. To design a solution to the travelling salesman problem (TSP) using genetic algorithm, we would formulate the algorithm as:<br>\n","1.   **Encoding Scheme**: Permutation or Order-based encoding denoting the order of traversal. For use in our code, we create a list of length N, where each bit denotes the order of the cities.<br>\n","For eg. [14, 13, 4, 3, 15, 6, 2, 8, 7, 12, 11, 5, 1, 17, 18, 19, 20, 9, 10, 16]<br>\n","2.   **Fitness Function**: The inverse of the total sum of distances travelled by the salesman going from one city to another and finally returning to the start is an efficient measure of the fitness of the chromosome. The more fit solutions will have lower total distance travelled.<br>\n","Fitness = 1 / total sum of distance travelled<br>\n","3.   **Genetic Operators**:<br>\n","  1.   **Selection**: Tournament selection or roulette wheel selection based on fitness values could be implemented for our problem.\n","  2.   **Crossover**: Using single-point crossover, we swap the sub-paths between ths two parents. In case, the city already exists in parent1 list, we use the remaining nodes from the parent2 list.\n","  3.   **Mutation**: Mutation could be implemented by randomly swapping one of the bits in the individual chromosome with another randomly selected bit from the same chromosome.\n","\n","**Q2.** Complete the program and generate a solution to the problem. <br>\n","> **Ans**. The completed code is implemented in *genetic_algorithm* method of the *TSP* class.<br>\n","One of the solutions to the problem as output by the program is <br>\n","\"_Order of Cities : [0, 15, 11, 8, 4, 1, 9, 10, 2, 14, 13, 16, 5, 7, 6, 12, 3], with total distance covered being , 2085_\"\n","\n","**Q3.** Compare to the optimal solution provided at the beginning. Is your result correct? <br>\n","> **Ans**. Since the genetic algorithm utilizes pseudo randomness for generation of chromosomes, and for genetic operators of selection, crossover and mutation, it is not always possible to reach the optimal solution on every run.<br>\n","Since we know the optimal cost to be 2085, we have set a satisfactory cost of 2090, which will terminate the GA if minimum cost within the generation reaches cost less than 2090. In most runs, we're able to get a satisfactory solution having cost < 2090, while in other cases, we're able to reach the optimal solution having cost 2085.

Other utility function such as *get_slope* to return slope of line connecting queen pieces in the chessboard, *get_min_max_fitness* to get minimum and maximum fitness in a generation, and

Specify the encoding scheme, fitness function and genetic operators. <br>\n","> **Ans**. To design a solution to the 8-queens problem using genetic algorithm, we would formulate the algorithm as:<br>\n","1.   **Encoding Scheme**: We would encode the solution as a list of N integers (8 for 8-queens, 12 for 12-queens), where each integer represents the column and its index represents the row of the queen placement on the chess board.<br>\n","For eg. [1, 5, 6, 3, 7, 2, 8]<br>\n","2.   **Fitness Function**: Fitness is inversely proportional to the number of queens under attack. To convert this relationship into a maximization problem, we calculate fitness as number of queens under attack subtracted from a maximum number, e.g. 100 in our case. <br>\n","Fitness = 100 - number of queens under attack<br>\n","3.   **Genetic Operators**:<br>\n","  1.   **Selection**: Tournament selection or roulette wheel selection based on fitness values could be implemented for our problem.\n","  2.   **Crossover**: Using single-point crossover, we swap the part of the chromosomes between ths two parents. \n","  3.   **Mutation**: Mutation could be implemented by randomly swapping one of the bits in the individual chromosome with another randomly selected bit from the same chromosome.\n","\n","**Q2.** Complete the program and generate a solution to the problem. <br>\n","> **Ans**. The completed code is implemented in the *genetic_algorithm* method of *Chess* class. <br>\n","One of the solutions given by the program for 8-queens problem is [4, 6, 0, 3, 1, 7, 5, 2] where none of the 8 queens on the boards are under check.\n","<br>Another solution provided by the program is shown

To design a solution to the map colouring problem using genetic algorithm, we would formulate the algorithm as:<br>\n","1.   **Encoding Scheme**: We would encode the solution as a list of N integers where N represents the no. of regions (11 in the code above), where each integer represents the colour index for that particular position<br>\n","For eg. [3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3]<br>\n","2.   **Fitness Function**: Fitness is inversely proportional to the number of neighbours having the same color. To convert this relationship into a maximization problem, we calculate fitness as number of neighbours with the same color subtracted from a maximum number, e.g. 100 in our case. <br>\n","Fitness = 100 - number of neighbours having the same color<br>\n","3.   **Genetic Operators**:<br>\n","  1.   **Selection**: Tournament selection or roulette wheel selection based on fitness values could be implemented for our problem.\n","  2.   **Crossover**: Using single-point crossover, we swap the part of the chromosomes between ths two parents. \n","  3.   **Mutation**: Mutation could be implemented by randomly swapping one of the bits in the individual chromosome with another randomly selected bit from the same chromosome.\n","\n","**Q2.** Complete the program and generate a solution to the problem. <br>\n","> **Ans**.
