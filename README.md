# 6 Weeks, 6 AI Projects

Welcome to the "6 Weeks, 6 AI Projects" repository! This repository is a curated collection of hands-on projects designed to take you on a journey through various AI topics using Python. Each week, you'll delve into a new area of artificial intelligence, solving three distinct problems related to the topic of the week. By the end of the six weeks, you'll have gained practical experience in a wide range of AI techniques and applications.

## Week 2: Search Algorithms
In Week 2, we'll delve into fundamental search algorithms. You'll solve three problems that involve searching through different types of data structures and finding optimal solutions.

   - Implement a DFS algorithm in Python to traverse a graph and find a path from a start node to a goal node.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
   - Implement a BFS algorithm in Python to search through a graph efficiently and find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node.

3. **A* Algorithm**
   - Implement the A* algorithm in Python to find the shortest path in a weighted graph from a start node to a goal node, considering both the cost to reach a node and the estimated cost to the goal.

## Week 3: Genetic Algorithms
In Week 3, we'll explore genetic algorithms, a powerful optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection. You'll tackle three problems where you'll apply genetic algorithms to find solutions to optimization problems.

1. **Genetic Algorithm Basics**
   - Implement a simple genetic algorithm in Python to optimize a given function.

2. **Solving the Knapsack Problem**
   - Use genetic algorithms to solve the Knapsack Problem, optimizing the selection of items to maximize value without exceeding a given weight limit.

3. **Genetic Programming**
   - Implement genetic programming in Python to evolve a mathematical function that fits a given set of data points.

## Week 4: Probabilistic Inference
Week 4 focuses on probabilistic inference, where you'll learn how to reason under uncertainty using probabilistic models. You'll work on three problems that involve probabilistic graphical models and inference algorithms.

1. **Bayesian Networks**
   - Implement Bayesian networks in Python to model probabilistic relationships between variables and perform inference.

2. **Inference in Bayesian Networks**
   - Perform inference in Bayesian networks to calculate probabilities of events given evidence.

3. **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**
   - Use Hidden Markov Models in Python to model sequential data and perform probabilistic reasoning.

## Week 5: Fuzzy Systems
Week 5 dives into fuzzy systems, adept at handling imprecise information and uncertainty. You'll tackle three problems that involve fuzzy logic and fuzzy inference systems.

1. **Fuzzy Sets and Membership Functions**
   - Implement fuzzy sets and membership functions in Python to represent and manipulate fuzzy logic.

2. **Fuzzy Logic Control**
   - Use fuzzy logic control in Python to regulate a simple system based on fuzzy rules.

3. **Fuzzy Inference System**
   - Build a fuzzy inference system in Python to make decisions based on fuzzy logic.

## Week 6: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Week 6 is dedicated to natural language processing (NLP), a field concerned with the interaction between computers and human language. You'll solve three problems that involve various NLP tasks.

1. **Text Tokenization and Preprocessing**
   - Tokenize and preprocess text data in Python to prepare it for further NLP tasks.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Build a sentiment analysis classifier in Python to classify the sentiment of text data.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - Implement named entity recognition (NER) in Python to identify and classify named entities in text data.

## Week 7: Computer Vision
In the final week, we'll explore computer vision, enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the real world. You'll tackle three problems related to image processing and computer vision tasks.

1. **Image Filtering and Edge Detection**
   - Implement image filtering and edge detection in Python to enhance and extract features from images.

2. **Object Detection**
   - Use Haar cascades in Python to detect objects within images.

3. **Image Classification with CNNs**
   - Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Python to classify images into different categories.

Each week, you'll find detailed instructions, starter code, and resources to help you complete the projects. Get ready to dive deep into the world of artificial intelligence and sharpen your Python skills!

Happy coding!
