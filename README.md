# 6 Weeks, 6 AI Projects

Welcome to the "6 Weeks, 6 AI Projects" repository! This repository is a curated collection of hands-on projects designed to take you on a journey through various AI topics using Python. Each week, you'll delve into a new area of artificial intelligence, solving three distinct tasks related to a specific area of artificial intelligence. The solutions for all three tasks are available in the form of a single jupyter notebook for each topic. This provides hands-on experience and diverse perspectives on various techniques and applications.

## Search Algorithms
Explore fundamental search algorithms and solve classic problems:

- **Route Planning Problem**: Implement search algorithms such as BFS or DFS to find the optimal path from a start point to a destination.
- **8-Puzzle Problem**: Solve the 8-puzzle problem using algorithms like A* search or iterative deepening DFS.
- **Maze Solver**: Develop a maze solver algorithm using search techniques like BFS or DFS to navigate through the maze from the start to the exit point.

## Genetic Algorithms
Discover optimization techniques inspired by natural selection:

- **Travelling Salesman Problem**: Tackle the classic Travelling Salesman Problem using algorithms like genetic algorithms.
- **8-Queens Problem**: Solve the 8-Queens Problem using genetic algorithms to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard without attacking each other.
- **Map Colouring Problem**: Implement genetic algorithms to color a map with 4 colors such that no neighboring regions share the same color.

## Probabilistic Inference
Dive into reasoning under uncertainty and probabilistic models:

- **Flower Classification**: Develop a machine learning model to classify flowers based on their features.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Implement a classification model to predict diabetes progression levels from routine medical data using probabilistic inference techniques.
- **Monty Hall Problem**: Analyze the Monty Hall problem using probabilistic inference techniques to determine the chance of winning when switching doors.
